1. Create Buttons
- Import
- Save to a database?

2. Import File (CSV or JSON)

3. Check if CSV or JSON
- Gaining information from the uri
- ContentResolver has security issues but more commonly used
- DocumentFile is more secure (but needs contentResolver still)
    -This doesn't open the file easily to read
    -Need to use ContentResolver and protect uri through validation

    -Android Studio Uri objects


4. Determine how to store the data
- A CSV and JSON store data differently
- Define an optimal way to parse
- Or Research a library for external use
    1. OpenCSV -> Can use for converting CSV
    2. Gson -> Can use for converting JSON
    3. Jackson -> Can use for converting JSON

4.1 Parsing a CSV File
- While Manual parsing is a few lines of code
    - This will not include edge cases
    - Take longer to determine all edge cases
    - Can do if there is more time once complete
- OpenCSV is shorter and has built in functions to help

4.2 Parsing a JSON File
- Options
    -Jackson
    -Gson
    -JSON.org
    -Manual
Manual parsing is a lot more code, especially due
to not knowing fields
- Jackson is a library that uses ObjectMapper
    - It handles type, missing fields, name, null, etc.

5. Send to specific Reader

6. CONVERT TO PARSED DATA

7. Save to Database or Local

SECURITY CODE: future addition

FileWriterInterface:
- The writer uses a table for only CSVwriter, this table takes up memory
and is unnecessary when converting to json. Look into Removal of step.



Questions {
Could arrays in JSON be supported or not?
    - What are the edge cases around that?
        - Representing Objects and Arrays in CSV can be very difficult
        for the sake of the exercise. Arrays are not supported
        in this application where we are strictly handling strings,
        ints, booleans.

        - Look into future Validation step to check correct data types
